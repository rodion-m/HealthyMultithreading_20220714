// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision

// WARNING: 
// - Instead of editing this directly, edit Properties for the project "AsyncIO", and these numbers should automatically be updated. 
// - This keeps NuGet package version and assembly versions in sync.
// - Caveat: Due to an issue in Visual Studio 2017 v15.5, these numbers might fail to update if this file is open, so double check that 
//   they have been updated and edit manually if need be.
